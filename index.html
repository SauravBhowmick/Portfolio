                        Hello! I’m Saurav Bhowmick, a passionate Renewable Energy and Data Engineer with a strong background in software development, data analytics, and energy systems. Currently, I completed my MSc in Renewable Energy and Data Engineering at Hochschule Offenburg, I specialize in integrating data-driven solutions with sustainable energy technologies.

With experience at Volkswagen Group Technology Solutions India and research work at the Institute for Sustainable Energy Systems, I have honed my skills in machine learning, data visualization, IoT, and power electronics. My projects range from energy data analysis and time-series forecasting to automation in industrial systems using Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn.

Beyond my professional work, I enjoy reading, playing football, jogging, and exploring new technologies. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of renewable energy solutions through AI and automation.

                <h4>Research Assistant</h4>
                <p>
                    I served as a Master's Thesis Student on the Integrale Forschung Energie für Elektromobilität: Vom Modell zur Anwendung (iFEMA) project. My research focused on analyzing and predicting grid quality anomalies in power electronic industrial systems, employing cross-correlation analysis, curve fitting techniques, and GridVis software for effective anomaly detection. I successfully identified the most causally significant features contributing to these anomalies, which formed the foundation for developing machine learning models capable of forecasting grid quality issues. To address the inherent challenge of imbalanced data in anomaly detection, I implemented specialized imbalanced learning techniques, complementing these with neural network architectures designed for future voltage predictions. The technical stack for this work encompassed Python, Node-RED, InfluxDB, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Prior to my thesis work, I served as a Research Assistant on the same project from January to August 2024. In this role, I developed Python scripts that established reliable communication pathways between Beckhoff PLCs and MQTT servers, creating a robust foundation for industrial IoT applications. I automated critical data logging processes from both PLC systems and MQTT topics into MySQL databases, significantly enhancing data collection efficiency. My contributions to IoT-based data engineering solutions enabled real-time energy monitoring capabilities, leveraging technologies including Python, MQTT, MySQL, Beckhoff PLC, and Node-RED to create an integrated monitoring ecosystem.

                <p>
                    From March 2020 to September 2023, I served as a Software Engineer at Volkswagen Group Technology Solutions India Pvt. Ltd. in the Digital Workplace department, working on the Group Package Factory (GPF) project. I specialized in application packaging using InstallShield and automated project-related tasks through PowerShell scripting. My responsibilities included working on Azure Intune as a Proof of Concept to streamline application deployment via cloud infrastructure. I also collaborated closely with Quality Analysts as a verification partner to ensure deliverables aligned precisely with customer requirements.
Prior to this, from September 2018 to March 2020, I began my career at Volkswagen as a Software Engineer Trainee in the same department and project. During this formative period, I focused on Robotic Process Automation using Automation Anywhere and successfully automated various project tasks. I also gained valuable experience in application packaging through MSI technology. My contributions during this period were recognized with both the Best Debutant Award for exceptional performance in a short timeframe and the Best Innovation Award for creative thinking that reduced manual effort by 20%, demonstrating my commitment to efficiency and innovation within the Volkswagen ecosystem.

                        <p>
                            During my time with Rotaract Club Freiburg, I am engaging in various community service activities, including a book donation drive for literacy initiatives, catering for club events, and an environmental restoration project in the Black Forest where I am helping plant trees. These experiences allow me to contribute to both social and environmental causes while connecting with like-minded individuals dedicated to community service.

                        <h3>Rotaractor at Rotaract Club of Pune Camp Pioneers</h3>
                        <p>
                            During my active membership with the Rotaract Club of Pune Camp Pioneers, I participated in several impactful humanitarian initiatives. I contributed to educational access by donating essential stationery items to two notable NGOs: Door Step School and Care Foundation (Emmanuel Public School). These donations helped provide necessary learning materials to underprivileged students, supporting their educational journey. Additionally, when the Mahad region was devastated by flooding, I contributed financially to relief efforts coordinated by our club. This monetary donation helped provide emergency supplies, temporary shelter, and other critical resources to affected families during their time of need. These experiences reinforced my commitment to community service and demonstrated the importance of collective action in addressing both ongoing societal needs and responding to unexpected crises.

                        <h3>Content Writer at Coders Evoke</h3>
                        <p>
                            During my volunteer role at Coders Evoke, I took on significant responsibilities in their digital marketing efforts by creating engaging advertisement posts. I developed compelling visual and written content strategically designed to promote the organization's events, workshops, and technical initiatives to the broader coding community. My work involved crafting eye-catching graphics and persuasive copy that effectively communicated the value proposition of Coders Evoke's offerings while maintaining consistent brand messaging. Through careful attention to design principles and marketing psychology, I helped increase engagement metrics across their social media platforms. This experience enhanced my creative skills while allowing me to contribute meaningfully to an organization dedicated to fostering coding education and community building among technology enthusiasts.
